							<p>At the start of quarantine, a few friends and I started a pokemon showdown league we called the Quarantine Pokemon League. We just finished our 3rd season and our group has grown to over 20 people. Shortly after the end of season 2, one of the memebers, Ali Turfah, and I wanted to make a website for the league as google sheets and its scripts were becoming tedious to use and honestly we just thought it could be fun.</p>
							<p>The websites backend is in Flask and the frontend is React. I primarily worked on the frontend as I did not have experience in Flask prior to this. However, I learned Flask as the production went on and was able to bugfix and understand the backend fully after a few days of Flash practice. We have implemented a roster, trade log, game data, rules, and standings page and are currently working on game details and stats.</p>
                            <p>One cool change I made recently was making the navbar dynamic by writing a function that converts a javascript object representation of the navbar tabs and subtabs into a functioning navbar. So as we add more pages, adding tabs will be as easy as adding another key to the object. <a href="https://github.com/aturfah/qpl_website/blob/main/website/src/components/Navigation.jsx">Link</a> to said file.</p>
